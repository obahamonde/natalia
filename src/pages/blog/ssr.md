| **Outcomes**          | High performance websites with great SEO. Optimal for web applications that require real-time data or have complex user interfaces.                                               | Single page apps, progressive web apps, and static sites that need Vue.js. Great for developers that prefer convention over configuration.                                                | High performance web applications. Simplicity in design allows for faster development cycles, although it's a bit less mature than Next.js or Nuxt.js.                                       |
| **Drawbacks**         | 1. Learning curve for developers new to React.js<br>2. You have to manage your own state (with Redux, Zustand, etc.)                                                              | 1. Less community plugins compared to Next.js<br>2. Slower build times for large sites compared to Next.js                                                                                | 1. Svelte's ecosystem is smaller than Vue's or React's<br>2. Not as feature-rich as Next.js or Nuxt.js                                                                                       |
| **Design Philosophy** | Next.js focuses on providing an all-in-one solution for React developers. It combines both SSR and SSG with zero configuration and offers a best-in-class "Developer Experience". | Nuxt.js brings a well-structured, highly customizable, and out-of-the-box ready solution for Vue developers. It follows a "Convention over Configuration" principle.                      | SvelteKit aims to simplify web development by removing unnecessary complexity. It believes in "Less is More", focusing on delivering high performance with less code and cognitive overhead. |
